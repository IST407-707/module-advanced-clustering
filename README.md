# Advanced Clustering

Covers:

1. **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC):** A method that builds nested clusters by successively merging or splitting groups.
2. **Density-Based Clustering: DBScan & HDBScan:** Techniques that cluster data into dense regions separated by sparser regions.
3. **Spectral Clustering:** A graph-based approach that uses the spectrum of the graph Laplacian to cluster nodes.
4. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** Probabilistic models that assume data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.
5. **Mean-shift Clustering:** A method that identifies modes in the data distribution using kernel density estimation.
